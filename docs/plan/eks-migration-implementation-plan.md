# EKS Migration Implementation Plan

## n8n Multi-Tenant Architecture with Strong Database Isolation

### Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for migrating from the current ECS/Fargate-based n8n deployment to a modern, scalable Amazon EKS infrastructure. The migration addresses critical business requirements including multi-tenancy with strong database isolation, clear separation between internal and external instances, improved cost efficiency, and enhanced scalability.

### Background & Business Drivers

**Current State Challenges:**

- Multiple separate ECS stacks across different AWS accounts (inefficient and costly)
- Limited scalability with current ECS + Fargate setup
- No multi-tenancy support with strong database isolation
- Operational complexity managing multiple separate environments

**Business Objectives:**

1. Deploy n8n internally and externally with appropriate data access controls
2. Implement multi-tenancy with strong database isolation between tenants
3. Consolidate infrastructure for improved cost efficiency and operational simplicity
4. Achieve scalability through modern Kubernetes-based architecture

### Solution Architecture Overview

The solution leverages Amazon EKS as the foundation for a modern, scalable, multi-tenant n8n deployment with the following key architectural components:

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### ADR-001: Database Isolation Strategy

**Decision**: RDS per tenant for maximum isolation

- **Rationale**: Strongest possible tenant isolation, regulatory compliance
- **Trade-offs**: Higher cost vs security and isolation guarantees
- **Implementation**: Terraform-automated RDS provisioning per tenant

#### ADR-002: Internal vs External Separation

**Decision**: Namespace separation + Network Policies + IRSA differentiation

- **Rationale**: Balance between security and operational simplicity
- **Benefits**: Clear network isolation, granular AWS permissions, simplified operations

#### ADR-003: Tenant Onboarding Automation

**Decision**: Semi-automated GitOps with approval workflow

- **Rationale**: Balance between automation efficiency and control
- **Implementation**: ArgoCD ApplicationSets with approval gates

### Multi-Tenancy Implementation Details

#### Tenant Isolation Strategy

**Network Isolation:**

```yaml
# Example Network Policy for Tenant Isolation
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: tenant-a-isolation
  namespace: tenant-a
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: tenant-a
  egress:
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: tenant-a
    - to: []
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443 # HTTPS egress for external APIs
```

**Database Isolation Architecture:**

- Each tenant receives dedicated RDS PostgreSQL instance
- No shared database infrastructure between tenants
- Tenant-specific backup and restore procedures
- Independent scaling and performance tuning per tenant

**Resource Isolation:**

```yaml
# Example Resource Quota per Tenant
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: tenant-a-quota
  namespace: tenant-a
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: 8Gi
    limits.cpu: "8"
    limits.memory: 16Gi
    persistentvolumeclaims: "10"
```

#### Helm Chart Architecture

```

### Cost Optimization Strategy

#### Resource Efficiency Improvements

**Current State (ECS across multiple accounts):**

- Fixed capacity allocation regardless of usage
- Separate load balancers and networking per account
- Limited resource sharing and optimization
- Manual scaling and management overhead

**Target State (Consolidated EKS):**

- Dynamic resource allocation with Karpenter
- Shared cluster infrastructure with tenant isolation
- Automatic bin-packing of workloads for optimal utilization
- Spot instance integration for non-critical workloads

#### Projected Cost Savings

**Infrastructure Consolidation:**

- 60-70% reduction in load balancer costs (shared ALB vs per-account)
- 40-50% reduction in networking costs (single VPC vs multiple)
- 30-40% reduction in compute costs through better utilization

**Operational Efficiency:**

- Reduced management overhead (single cluster vs multiple accounts)
- Automated scaling reduces over-provisioning
- Standardized deployment procedures across all tenants

### Security Architecture

#### Internal vs External Instance Separation

**Internal n8n Instances:**

- No access to customer data buckets or databases
- Limited AWS permissions for internal operational data only
- Network policies prevent access to external data sources
- Monitoring and auditing for compliance verification

**External n8n Instances:**

- Controlled access to customer data based on tenant requirements
- Comprehensive audit logging of all customer data access
- Network policies allow access to tenant-specific resources only
- Regular security assessments and compliance validation

#### IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) Implementation

```yaml
# Example IRSA configuration for Internal Instance
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: n8n-internal-sa
  namespace: n8n-internal
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/n8n-internal-role

---
# Example IRSA configuration for External Instance
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: n8n-external-sa
  namespace: n8n-external
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/n8n-external-role
```

### Scalability Implementation

#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: n8n-main-hpa
  namespace: tenant-a
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: n8n-main
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: memory
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80
```

#### Karpenter Node Provisioning

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1alpha5
kind: Provisioner
metadata:
  name: n8n-provisioner
spec:
  requirements:
    - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
      operator: In
      values: ["spot", "on-demand"]
    - key: kubernetes.io/arch
      operator: In
      values: ["amd64"]
  limits:
    resources:
      cpu: 1000
      memory: 1000Gi
  providerRef:
    name: n8n-nodepool
  ttlSecondsAfterEmpty: 30
```

### Migration Strategy

#### Migration Approach: Blue-Green with Gradual Cutover

**Phase 1: Preparation**

- Set up complete EKS environment with all components
- Validate functionality with test data and synthetic workloads
- Establish monitoring and alerting for new environment

**Phase 2: Parallel Operation**

- Run both ECS and EKS environments in parallel
- Migrate test and development workloads first
- Validate data synchronization and application behavior

**Phase 3: Production Migration**

- Migrate production workloads during low-traffic periods
- Use DNS and load balancer cutover for zero-downtime migration
- Maintain ECS environment as fallback until stability confirmed

**Phase 4: Cleanup**

- Decommission ECS resources after successful migration validation
- Update documentation and operational procedures
- Conduct post-migration performance and cost analysis

#### Data Migration Considerations

**Database Migration:**

- Use AWS DMS for PostgreSQL data migration with minimal downtime
- Implement data validation and integrity checks
- Plan for rollback procedures in case of migration issues

**Configuration Migration:**

- Export existing n8n workflows and configurations
- Validate compatibility with new environment
- Implement automated configuration deployment via GitOps

### Risk Management

#### Medium Risk Areas

**Cost Overrun with RDS per Tenant**

- _Monitoring_: Real-time cost monitoring and alerting
- _Optimization_: Reserved instance planning and rightsizing automation
- _Alternative_: Schema-based isolation if costs exceed budgets

**Karpenter Learning Curve**

- _Mitigation_: Start with simple configurations and gradual complexity increase
